## Currently working as a software engineer and owner of [Dikitada Studio](https://dikitada.com/) âœ¨

Fun-fact: "When I was 21 y.o, I've set long-term mission until I've reached my 30's to contribute to atleast 10 company (well established and startup-like), for what? just because I really loved mix and mingle and really love to learn from different culture, and now I am 25 y.o here I am with my working experience XD"
